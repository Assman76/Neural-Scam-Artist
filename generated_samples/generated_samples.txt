Dear Sir / Madam,
Hello my name is Mrs.adiah kabel. I am a widow; I got your contact from a Yahoo search while I was searching for a person or family member to help me move a substantial amount of money out of Africa. However, I wish to introduce myself officially: I am Mrs.adiah kabel a citizen of Lome-Togo, married to late Dr. Robert kabel. I am a 60 years old widower, suffering from long time cancer of the liver. My condition is critical and is quite obvious that I may not live more than 2 months according to my doctors. This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage.
I have some funds that I inherited from my late husband, the sum of 5.5m GBP (Five Million Five hundred thousand British Pounds), which he deposited with a Bank here in Lome-Togo and I urgently needed someone to help me use this money for charity works and also help the less privileges. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are bourgeois people and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you further information's.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am a lawyer in Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia. I am in search of a reliable person to assist me in the transfer of US$18,500,000.00 (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to a foreign account. This money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.
The reason why I contacted you is because you have the same last name with my late client. I have plans to do investment in your country, like real estate and industrial production. The money in question is from an over-invoiced contract amount awarded to a foreign firm in 2009 for the construction of a road network in the city.
If you agree to my business proposal, further details of the transfer will be forwarded to you as soon as I receive your return mail.Please kindly reply to my personal email: [wong_meng2@yahoo.com.hk]

Barr Wong Meng.

 ATTACHED IS THE NEW MESSAGE
Dear Sir/Madam
I am Mrs. Linda White from the United States of America. I am married to late Mr. Williams White who worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Malaysia for twenty years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for twenty years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $4,500,000.00 in a bank here in Malaysia. Presently this money is still with the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to my cancer illness (cancer of the lever and stroke).
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a good God fearing individual that will utilize this money in accordance with my instruction, I want a person that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want

Dear,
I am Joseph Kut, a Zimbabwean. I got your contact through a reliable source and i decided to contact you for your kind assistance and understanding. My father Chief Joseph Kut was a very rich Diamond/Gold dealer in Zimbabwe and also a successful businessman before his untimely death during the land dispute that just happened in Zimbabwe.
During the land dispute in Zimbabwe, it was alarmed so much by the rest of the world on the land crisis that lead to the killing and mob action by the supporters of the President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers.
My father was among the rich and famous people murdered during the land dispute, but there was no trace of their families. I lost my mother in one of these attacks and now I live in a refugee camp here in Kigali, Republic of Rwanda with my only brother Morris.
My father deposited the sum of USD$9.8Million with a Bank here in Kigali, Republic of Rwanda. He told me that he deposited the money with me that the money was meant for importation of machinery and chemical for his farm machinery.
I have tried to contact the bank but they were non-respondent, they did not tell me the story.
I am seeking for your kind assistance

Dear Sir,
I am Mr. Johnson J. Amadi, the Manager of Bill and Exchange at the foreign remittance department of the Bank of Africa. I am contacting you in respect of an abandoned sum of US$19,300,000.00 {Nineteen Million Three Hundred Thousand US dollars} in my branch.
I discovered this money during our annual auditing of accounts. The owner of this account is a foreigner, a miner by profession and he died since in February 2003. Nobody has operated in this account till date. Our bank cannot release the money from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreign partner and in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for any expenses incured during the course of this transaction and 50% would be for me. I will visit your country immediately the money has been transferred into your nominated bank account.
Please I would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and delete it if you are not interested. Upon receipt of your reply

 CONDITION:
The sum of 6,600,000.00(Six Million six hundred thousand Euro) is lying in a financial institution in Europe. The information we have is correct because of the law passed by the presidency, we are only doing this because of the fact that some members of my ministry were duped by some unscrupulous element from the office. For example, former finance minister, Dr. Antonio Guterres whose name and address is not given to you because of his position in office now, said you were involved in an auto accident. He will surely approve payment to you the sum of 6,600,000.00 (Six Million six hundred thousand Euro).
The entire documentations of the said fund is already in existence now. Kindly send your contact numbers, the contact details for more clarification and the transfer of this fund. All expenses incurred in the cause of the transfer has been paid. Your urgent response is needed.

I am Mr. David Mark, the Special Assistant to the newly appointed United Nation Secretary General. I am in the process of setting up a Special Committee on Rewards and Compensation and also working on how to pay all victims of scam.
This committee was set up to discover all outstanding unpaid and lost funds, contract and lottery funds, inheritance and compensation funds, contractors and lottery funds, which the UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION, WORLD BANK AND UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION have mapped out for this payment.
However, we discovered that your email address was among those that are yet to receive their compensation payment and that is why I am contacting you, to stop all the transfer process and fund transfer to avoid the hopeless situation created by those who are yet to receive their fund.
You are advised to contact me immediately to enable us start the transfer process.

PAYMENT NOTIFICATION.
Attention: Beneficiary
This is to notify you that the United Nations Compensation Commission has been mandated to pay you part payment of US$1.5Million through ATM VISA CARD which you can use to withdraw cash from any ATM MACHINE around the world.
However, we received a petition from one Mrs. Susan C. Johnson, who claimed to be your next of kin. She further told us that you suffered and died of a throat cancer. According to her, this fund is to be paid to you because of your lack of co-operation and not fulfilling the obligations giving to you in respect of your contract/inheritance payment.
Please if you are interested in receiving your fund this way, kindly get back to us and we will forward your ATM VISA CARD to her for confirmation and immediate delivery to your home address. We expect your urgent response to this email to enable us monitor this payment effectively thereby making contact with Mrs. Susan C. Johnson.
We look forward to hear from you.
Yours Sincerely,

His heart condition was due to the death of all the members of his family in the tsunami disaster on the 26th December 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.
My late Client has a deposit of Nine million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars with a Bank,here in the United Kingdom. The bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or the account will be confiscated.
I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.
I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my late Client, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Linda Mccarthy, an attorney at law. I am the personal attorney to a foreigner who was a contractor with British Gas Company in London and unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370) in March 8, 2014. You can read more about the crash on visiting this site:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/670929.stm
Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail.
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged. Particularly, the Standard Chartered Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about ($25 Million USD).
The bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over four years now I seek your consent to present you

Good Day and God Bless,

Wife of Late Mr. John K. W. Morgan, I am very pleased to inform you that late Mr. John K. W. Morgan, a citizen of your country who deposited US$19,700,000.00 in our bank, died in a fatal motor accident along Sagamu express road.
Since his death I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the motor accident leaving nobody behind for the claim.
It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the bank will release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, and 5% would be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% would be for me and my family.

Greetings to you,
I am Mrs. Maria Williams, a British citizen, married to Mr. Johnson Williams, who worked with British Petroleum in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2011. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of Five million Pounds Sterling (Â£5.000.000.00) with a Bank here in Ivory Coast. Presently, this money is still in the bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church, church or individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.
I want a church, individual that will use this fund according to the desire of my late husband to fund the upkeep of widows, widowers, orphans, destitute, the down-trodden, physically challenged children, barren-women and persons who prove to be genuinely handicapped financially.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are bourgeois and

BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO
Dear Friend,
I am Mr. Mohamed Ahmed, the director of Operation in the International Remittance Department Bank of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. I have decided to contact you in a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end.
During the auditing and accounting of our bank's last accounts, it was discovered in my department that there has been a sum of $5.5 million dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family on 31 July 2000 in a plane crash.
Since his death, nobody has operated on this account till date, this is the reason why I decided to use my position and influence here to make sure that the fund is remitted to the account that the customer had. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the account is a foreigner too.
I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account, while 70% would be for me.
================================================================================

Dear Sir,
I am Mr. Kofi Mensah, I have a business proposal of $11.5 million U.S dollars.
If you are interested, please contact me for more details.
